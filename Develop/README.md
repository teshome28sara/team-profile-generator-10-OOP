# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## My Task

> My  task was to build a Node.js command-line application 
that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, 
so my task was  
also to  write a unit test for every part of mycode and ensure that it 
passes each test.

## Completed  Criteria

✅ Given a command-line application that accepts user input
when I am prompted for my team members and their information
then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

✅ WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN the  default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

✅ When I click on the GitHub username
then  that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

✅  When I start the application, then I am asked  which team member I would like to add to the profile and given a list of choice


✅ When i select which team member i would like to add, then i am asked common questions such as their name, ID number and email adress. 
Depending on which team number I selected from the list to add, I am asked specific question pertaining to that team member, such as office number, github username,  or school.

✅  after selecting a team member to add and answering their questions, i am cycled back to the choice menu where i have the option to add a team member or select "no more team members are needed", where I can finish creating my team.

✅If i select the "no more team members are needed, then  I exit the application and the HTML page with the teams i added is generated.
